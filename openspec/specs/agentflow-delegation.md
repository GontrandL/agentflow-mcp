# AgentFlow Delegation Specification

**Status**: Current Truth
**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14

## Overview

AgentFlow delegation system enables cost-effective AI coding by delegating heavy implementation tasks to cheap models while maintaining quality.

---

## Core Requirements

### REQ-1: Cost Reduction

The system SHALL provide 99%+ cost savings by delegating to cheap models.

**Rationale**: Claude Sonnet 4 costs $3/M tokens, DeepSeek V3 costs $0.14/M tokens (21x cheaper).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Average delegation cost SHALL be < $0.20 per task
- Cost savings SHALL be >= 99% compared to direct Claude usage
- Cost tracking SHALL be accurate within 5%

### REQ-2: Quality Validation

The system SHALL validate all delegated output with 0-100 scoring.

**Rationale**: Cheap models may produce bugs or incomplete code requiring validation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Validation score SHALL use 30pts completeness + 40pts correctness + 30pts production-ready
- Threshold SHALL be configurable (default: 80)
- Failed validation SHALL trigger auto-retry with fix instructions

### REQ-3: Parallel Execution

The system SHALL support 3-8 parallel workers for speedup.

**Rationale**: Multiple independent tasks can execute simultaneously.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Pool SHALL manage 3-5 workers with queue distribution
- Parallel speedup SHALL be 5-7x vs sequential
- Workers SHALL not interfere with each other

### REQ-4: API Validation

The system SHALL validate API keys before delegation to prevent crashes.

**Rationale**: Invalid keys cause 100% failure rate in parallel workers.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- APIValidator SHALL perform 3-layer validation (format, connectivity, test call)
- Invalid providers SHALL be skipped automatically
- Worker success rate SHALL be >= 95%

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance

- Delegation SHALL complete within 8 minutes for 500-line tasks
- Context preparation SHALL complete within 0.5 seconds
- Validation SHALL complete within 2 seconds

### NFR-2: Reliability

- System SHALL handle API failures gracefully with fallback
- Workers SHALL not crash on invalid input
- State SHALL be recoverable after interruption

### NFR-3: Observability

- All operations SHALL be logged with structured logging
- Cost tracking SHALL be real-time
- Metrics SHALL be queryable via API

---

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Delegation

**Given**: A task "Implement REST API endpoint" with clear requirements
**When**: User delegates via SmartOrchestrator
**Then**:
- Task is executed by DeepSeek V3
- Output is validated (score >= 80)
- Result is returned
- Cost is tracked

### Scenario 2: Parallel Worker Pool

**Given**: 4 independent implementation tasks
**When**: User spawns parallel workers
**Then**:
- All 4 workers execute simultaneously
- Wall time is ~8 min (not 32 min sequential)
- All outputs are validated
- Total cost is < $0.50

### Scenario 3: Quality Failure and Retry

**Given**: A complex task with validation threshold 80
**When**: First attempt scores 65
**Then**:
- System generates fix instructions
- Task is retried with feedback
- Second attempt scores 87
- Result is accepted

## Future Enhancements

1. Model auto-selection based on task analysis
2. Estimated cost before execution
3. Delegation history and analytics
4. Real-time progress tracking
