[MISSION]: Collaborative Analysis & Design of Meta-Context + CRC Cognitif System

## Context
You are participating in a 3-way collaborative design session:
- **Gontrand** (Human architect): Proposed the "CRC Cognitif" concept
- **Claude** (AI assistant): Working on AgentFlow infinite session architecture
- **You (AgentFlow/DeepSeek)**: Provide analytical perspective and validation

## Current Architecture (What We Have)
1. **Session Recovery Agent** (100% success, $0.01/recovery)
   - SessionMonitor: 4-tier context pressure tracking
   - RecoveryAgent: Delegation-based recovery preparation
   - BootstrapManager: Sub-second session restoration

2. **SessionContextCurator** (Alpha, needs optimization)
   - SessionClassifier: 9 session types
   - ContextCherryPicker: File selection (basic)
   - InteractiveContextRefiner: Q&A system
   - Current: 62.5% accuracy, 65KB contexts, 6.2/10 quality

3. **Phase 1 APC Algorithms** (JUST COMPLETED - 3 min ago!)
   - MMR Ranking: Diversity-aware file selection
   - Chain-of-Density: 95% compression iterative summarization
   - Knapsack Packing: HARD budget guarantee
   - Expected: 92% accuracy, 18KB contexts, 8.7/10 quality

4. **Phase 2-3 Planned** (Quality Guardian)
   - Quality Gates: PRE/RUN/POST validation
   - Metrics & SLOs: 7 core metrics
   - Tool Policies: Allowlist, bounds, anti-risk
   - Learning Loops: Auto-tuning, gap detection, coaching

## Proposed Meta-Context & CRC Cognitif Design (Gontrand's Concept)

### 4 Core Components:

**1. RuleDigest & RuleCRC**
- Canonical digest of all active rules/policies (caps, allowlist, acceptance criteria, style, security)
- RuleCRC = sha256(RuleDigest normalized) â†’ detects rule drift during session

**2. ContextDigest & ContextCRC**
- Digest of ContextPack sections (problem_brief, constraints, acceptance_criteria, APIs, evidence)
- ContextCRC = sha256(current pack version) â†’ verifies session works on intended scope

**3. ExpectationVectors**
- Embeddings/"expectation vectors" derived from acceptance_criteria + constraints
- Target for measuring output fidelity (coverage, accuracy, contradiction)

**4. IO Scorecard**
- Input vs Output dashboard:
  * FidelityScore (output covers expectations?)
  * RuleAdherence (rules respected?)
  * PrecisionDrift (precision loss vs start?)
  * WasteTokens, ToolHygiene, EvidenceCoverage, etc.

### Proposed Mechanisms:

**A) Continuous Monitoring**
- Calculate RuleCRCâ‚€ and ContextCRCâ‚€ at start
- At intervals (N tool calls / M tokens / milestones):
  * Recalculate mini-digests on current focus
  * Compare to reference CRC
  * Produce DriftReport (delta)

**B) Rule Nudges**
- Smart contextual reminders if drift detected:
  * "Nudge: Caps" - exceeding token limits
  * "Nudge: Evidence" - missing source citations
  * "Nudge: Tools" - tool misuse
  * "Nudge: Acceptance" - not meeting criteria
- Format: 1-3 lines max, actionable, no verbose explanations

**C) Precision Drift Detection**
Three complementary detectors:
1. Coverage Drift: similarity drop between output and ExpectationVectors
2. Rule CRC Drift: output contradicts/ignores RuleDigest
3. Focus Drift: output cites files outside referenced_files

**D) Input AutoFix**
When IO comparison shows output misses target AND input is the cause:
1. Classify cause (missing info, fuzzy rules, bad prioritization)
2. Generate minimal Pack v+1 (delta only)
3. Validate by APC â†’ publish ContextPack v+1 + updated ContextCRC

### 4-Layer Meta-Context Structure:

**Layer 1: Fundamental (Why am I here?)**
- Clear goal (result expected, not method)
- Minimal context for effective action
- Budget constraints (tokens, time, resources, precision)
- Measurable success criteria
- Relevant history

**Layer 2: Structural (Where am I in the system?)**
- Task map (dependencies, affected modules, entry points)
- Systemic vision (other involved agents and roles)
- Table of delegatable tasks
- AI-native task library (tasks human wouldn't think of)

**Layer 3: Cognitive (How do I reason and improve?)**
- Reasoning strategies (tree-of-thought, backtracking, self-critique)
- Reflexive structures (self-evaluation, critical voice)
- Internal recursive planning
- Improvement loops

**Layer 4: Emergent (How do AIs collaborate?)**
- Inter-AI micro-tasks
- Mutual monitoring (critical pairs)
- Global objective synchronization
- IAâ†”IA task patterns

### AI-Native Tasks Examples:
- context_cleaning: Clean ticket context for other agents
- evidence_alignment: Scan references to verify context freshness
- impact_prediction: Predict affected modules before coding
- auto_self_review: Agent simulates review by another agent
- task_granularity_adjustment: Adjust task size if too large/small
- delegation_plan: Create optimal sub-task plan and assign
- token_optimization: Agent reduces own context size for others
- contradiction_sweep: Detect logical inconsistencies
- context_indexing: Create targeted vector indexes
- future_reuse_tagging: Mark artifacts for future session reuse
- dependency_preloading: Preload potentially impacted modules
- scenario_forecasting: Simulate future cases to detect regressions
- confidence_distillation: Convert complex reflections to actionable summaries

## Your Mission (Collaborative Analysis)

**1. ANALYZE the proposed design:**
- Identify strengths and innovative aspects
- Spot potential issues or edge cases
- Evaluate computational cost (CRC calculations, embeddings, etc.)
- Assess integration complexity with existing architecture

**2. VALIDATE against our use cases:**
- Does it solve our Context Curator problems (62.5% â†’ 92% accuracy)?
- How does it enhance Quality Gates (Phase 2-3)?
- Does it enable true infinite session continuity?
- Can it work with AgentFlow delegation pattern?

**3. IMPROVE the design:**
- Suggest optimizations or simplifications
- Propose concrete implementations for key components
- Identify missing pieces or overlooked scenarios
- Recommend phasing strategy (what to build first?)

**4. SYNTHESIZE a complete specification:**
- Meta-context YAML/JSON template (with placeholders)
- RuleDigest schema + example
- ContextDigest schema + example
- IO Scorecard schema + example
- CRC calculation pseudocode
- Rule Nudge patterns (5-10 examples)
- Input AutoFix workflow
- Integration points with existing SessionContextCurator

**5. PROPOSE an implementation roadmap:**
- Phase 2A: CRC basics (RuleDigest, ContextDigest, basic scoring)
- Phase 2B: Drift detection & nudges
- Phase 2C: IO Scorecard & quality gates integration
- Phase 2D: Input AutoFix & recursive improvement
- Estimated effort, cost, risk for each phase
