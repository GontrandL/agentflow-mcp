## 🔍 Detailed Comparison: OpenSpec vs AgentFlow/APC

### OpenSpec: What It DOES Do

**1. Specification Management** ✅
```bash
openspec/
├── specs/          # Current truth (requirements)
└── changes/        # Proposed updates (change tracking)
```

**Purpose**:
- Define WHAT to build (requirements)
- Track WHY changes are needed
- Maintain single source of truth for specs

**Example Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Draft change proposal
/openspec:proposal "Add JWT authentication"

# 2. Review specs (human approval)
openspec view

# 3. Implement (AI follows specs)
/openspec:apply auth-jwt

# 4. Archive completed change
openspec archive auth-jwt
```

**Value**:
- ✅ Clear requirements before coding
- ✅ Human-AI alignment on specs
- ✅ Brownfield-first (existing codebases)
- ✅ Change tracking and history
- ✅ Multi-tool support (Claude, Cursor, etc.)

---

### AgentFlow: What It DOES Do

**1. Cost-Effective Delegation** ✅
```python
# Delegate heavy implementation to cheap models
orchestrator = SmartOrchestrator()
result = orchestrator.orchestrate(task)
# Cost: $0.08 vs $17 (99.6% savings)
```

**Purpose**:
- Execute IMPLEMENTATION efficiently
- 99.6% cost savings (DeepSeek $0.14/M vs Claude $3/M)
- Parallel worker execution (3-8 workers)
- Quality validation (0-100 scoring)

**Example Workflow**:
```python
# Given a spec, generate implementation
task = "Implement JWT auth per openspec/specs/auth.md"
result = orchestrator.orchestrate(task)
# → 500 lines of code generated for $0.12
```

**Value**:
- ✅ 99.6% cost reduction
- ✅ Parallel execution (5-7x speedup)
- ✅ Quality validation
- ✅ Auto-correction via iteration

---

### APC: What It DOES Do

**1. Context Compression** ✅
```python
# Compress 100K token conversation → 8K
compressed = generate_compressed_context(history, task)
# 12x compression ratio
```

**Purpose**:
- Infinite coding sessions
- 12x context reduction (100K → 8K)
- Preserve key decisions and code
- Enable long-term session continuity

**Example Workflow**:
```python
# Conversation at 80K tokens
compressed = prepare_context(conversation_history)
# → 6.5K tokens (91% reduction)
# → Continue with fresh context
```

**Value**:
- ✅ Infinite sessions (no token limit)
- ✅ 92% context reduction
- ✅ Key decision preservation
- ✅ Session continuity

## 🔄 How OpenSpec COMPLEMENTS AgentFlow/APC

### Perfect Integration Workflow

**Step 1: Spec Definition (OpenSpec)**
```bash
# Human defines WHAT to build
/openspec:proposal "Add user authentication with JWT"

# OpenSpec creates specs in openspec/specs/auth.md
# Human reviews and approves
openspec view
```

**Step 2: Implementation (AgentFlow Delegation)**
```python
# AI reads spec and delegates implementation
spec = read_file("openspec/specs/auth.md")
task = f"Implement per spec:\n\n{spec}"

# AgentFlow delegates to cheap model
orchestrator = SmartOrchestrator()
result = orchestrator.orchestrate(task)
# Cost: $0.12 vs $3.50 (96% savings)
```

**Step 3: Validation (APC)**
```python
# APC validates generated code
validation = validate_output(task=spec, output=result)
# Score: 87/100 ✅

if validation['score'] < 80:
    # Auto-retry with fix instructions
    result = orchestrator.orchestrate(task, previous_attempt=result)
```

**Step 4: Archive (OpenSpec)**
```bash
# Human approves implementation
/openspec:archive auth-jwt

# OpenSpec moves specs to openspec/specs/ (source of truth)
```

**Step 5: Context Management (APC)**
```python
# After 50K tokens, compress conversation
compressed = prepare_context(conversation_history)
# 12x compression → continue with fresh context
```
