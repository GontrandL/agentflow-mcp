## ðŸ“‹ Research Brief

### Challenge Statement

Design a system architecture that enables AI coding agents to work **indefinitely** without hitting context window limits (typically 200K tokens). Current AI agents fail after 4-6 hours of work due to context compaction, which causes:

- Loss of critical project state
- Manual recovery procedures
- Developer intervention required
- Degraded code quality
- Session interruptions

### Goal

Create a **proactive**, **autonomous**, **self-sustaining** AI coding agent with:
1. **Unlimited session duration** (no context compaction ever)
2. **Zero state loss** (perfect continuity across sessions)
3. **Self-evolution capabilities** (learns and improves autonomously)
4. **Cost-efficient operation** (maintain 99%+ cost savings vs premium models)
5. **< 30 second recovery** from any interruption

## ðŸš€ Context for Your Research

**Current System** (what we have):

- SmartOrchestrator with 3-tier waterfall (FREE â†’ mid â†’ premium)
- Parallel worker pool (3-5 concurrent agents)
- Quality validation and escalation
- Real-time dashboard monitoring
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration

**The Problem**:
- After 4-6 hours, context hits 200K token limit
- Emergency compaction loses 10-20% of nuanced state
- Manual recovery takes 10-15 minutes
- Developer intervention required
- Session interruptions are disruptive

**Our Vision**:
- Proactive memory management (offload at 80%, not 95%)
- External state storage (disk + vector DB + graph DB)
- Stateless operations (all state in files, not context)
- Session continuity protocol (<2KB pickup instructions)
- Self-evolution (meta-learning from session logs)
- **Indefinite sessions** (weeks/months without compaction)
