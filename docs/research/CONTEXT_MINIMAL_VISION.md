# 🧠 Context-Minimal Autonomous AI Coder - Vision & Design Brief

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: 🎯 CONCEPT PHASE - Ready for Research & Implementation
**Goal**: Self-sustaining AI coding agent that works indefinitely without memory loss

---

## 💡 Core Vision

> **"An AI coding agent that maintains <20% context usage perpetually, using external memory, stateless operations, and self-documentation - enabling truly autonomous, long-running coding sessions without compaction limits."**

### The Problem We're Solving

**Current State** (Post-Compaction Reality):
- Claude Code: 200K token limit
- Long sessions hit context limits (~4-6 hours)
- Compaction loses critical state
- Reactive recovery (session review docs, manual reconstruction)
- Developer intervention required

**Pain Points**:
1. Context bloat from large file reads
2. State accumulation in conversation history
3. Repetitive information in responses
4. Emergency compaction loses nuanced state
5. No proactive memory management

---

## 🎯 Target Architecture

### 1. **Persistent External Memory** (Not Internal Context)

```
PROJECT MEMORY SYSTEM
├── project_memory.json          [Structured state store]
├── context_index.json            [What's in memory vs disk]
├── session_continuity.json       [Pickup instructions]
├── task_states/                  [Per-task state files]
│   ├── task_001_state.json
│   ├── task_002_state.json
│   └── ...
└── checkpoints/                  [Session checkpoints]
    ├── checkpoint_23_10_15.json
    └── ...
```

**Existing Assets to Leverage**:
- ✅ SESSION_COMPLETE_2025-10-13.md (session summaries)
- ✅ pool_status.py (runtime state tracking)
- ✅ dashboard.py (task tracking UI)
- ✅ DELEGATION_SYSTEM.md (architecture docs)

**What's Needed**:
- JSON-based state serialization
- Minimal context footprint (<1KB per task)
- Fast state retrieval (indexed by task_id)
- Session continuity protocol

### 2. **Context Budget Management**

```python
class ContextBudgetManager:
    """Real-time token tracking with proactive offloading"""

    MAX_TOKENS = 200_000
    SAFE_THRESHOLD = 0.80  # Trigger offload at 80%
    CRITICAL_THRESHOLD = 0.95  # Emergency offload

    OPERATION_BUDGETS = {
        "read_file": 1_000,      # Avg file read
        "delegation": 500,        # Task description
        "response": 2_000,        # Claude response
        "tool_overhead": 300,     # Tool use metadata
        "todo_write": 200,        # TodoWrite tracking
    }

    def can_afford(self, operation: str) -> bool:
        """Check if operation fits in budget"""
        estimated = self.OPERATION_BUDGETS[operation]
        return (self.current_usage + estimated) < (self.MAX_TOKENS * self.SAFE_THRESHOLD)

    def offload_to_disk(self):
        """
        Proactive offloading at 80% usage:
        1. Write state to project_memory.json
        2. Create minimal continuity.json (<2K tokens)
        3. Clear non-essential context
        4. Resume seamlessly
        """
        pass
```

**Key Metrics**:
- Current usage: Track in real-time
- Projected usage: Estimate next operations
- Offload trigger: 80% (not 95%)
- Recovery time: < 30 seconds

### 3. **Stateless Operations** (File-Based State)

```python
# ❌ BAD: Stateful (Context-Heavy)
class StatefulAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []      # Grows indefinitely in context
        self.state = {...}     # All in memory
        self.results = []      # More context bloat

    def work(self, task):
        self.history.append(task)  # CONTEXT BLOAT
        result = self.process(task)
        self.results.append(result)  # MORE BLOAT
        return result

# ✅ GOOD: Stateless (Context-Minimal)
class StatelessAgent:
    @staticmethod
    def work(task: str, state_file: str) -> dict:
        """
        Stateless operation:
        1. Load state from disk (NOT context)
        2. Do work
        3. Save state to disk (NOT context)
        4. Return ONLY minimal summary
        """
        state = json.load(open(state_file))  # From disk
        result = process(task, state)
        json.dump(state, open(state_file, 'w'))  # To disk

        # Return ONLY summary (< 100 tokens)
        return {
            "status": "complete",
            "output_file": "/path/to/result.py",
            "state_file": state_file,
            "summary": "Added auth logic (95 lines)"
        }
```

**Principles**:
- No instance variables (all state on disk)
- Idempotent operations (can retry safely)
- Minimal return values (summaries, not full output)
- File-based communication (not context passing)

### 4. **Self-Documenting Delegation**

```python
CONTEXT_AWARE_TASK_TEMPLATE = '''
[CONTEXT-MINIMAL DELEGATION]

## Pre-Work: Memory Offload
Write current state to: {state_file}
Expected size: < 1KB

## Task
{actual_task_description}

## Constraints
- Keep ALL output in files (NOT in response)
- Return ONLY summary (< 100 words)
- Write state to disk before returning

## Output Format (STRICT)
{
  "status": "complete",
  "output_files": ["/path/to/file1.py", "/path/to/file2.py"],
  "state_file": "/tmp/task_{id}_state.json",
  "summary": "Brief description (< 100 words)",
  "metrics": {
    "lines_of_code": 250,
    "files_created": 2,
    "tests_added": 10
  }
}

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Task completed
- ✅ State written to disk
- ✅ Memory footprint < 1KB
- ✅ All details in external files
'''
```

### 5. **Session Continuity Protocol**

```json
{
  "session_id": "2025-10-13-23:30",
  "context_usage_percent": 45,
  "last_checkpoint": "/path/to/checkpoint.json",
  "active_tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task_001",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "state_file": "/tmp/task_001_state.json",
      "progress": 0.75,
      "next_action": "Continue implementation from line 245"
    }
  ],
  "memory_locations": {
    "project_state": "/path/to/project_memory.json",
    "architecture": "/path/to/DELEGATION_SYSTEM.md",
    "session_log": "/path/to/SESSION_LOG.md",
    "checkpoints": "/path/to/checkpoints/"
  },
  "resume_instructions": "Load task_001 state, continue from line 245, review recent changes in git log"
}
```

**Compaction Strategy**:
```
80% Usage → Proactive Offload:
  1. Write session_continuity.json
  2. Offload completed task states
  3. Keep only active task summaries
  4. Continue work

95% Usage → Emergency Protocol:
  1. Panic write everything
  2. Force checkpoint
  3. Clear all non-critical context
  4. Resume from continuity.json
```

### 6. **Self-Evolution Framework**

```python
class SelfEvolvingAgent:
    """Agent that improves its own code and processes"""

    def analyze_session_performance(self, session_log: str):
        """Learn from past sessions"""
        # Parse session logs
        # Identify inefficiencies
        # Generate improvement suggestions
        pass

    def optimize_own_code(self):
        """Meta-programming: Agent improves itself"""
        # Read own source code
        # Identify optimization opportunities
        # Generate refactoring tasks
        # Self-delegate improvements
        pass

    def learn_context_patterns(self):
        """Identify what causes context bloat"""
        # Analyze token usage patterns
        # Find high-cost operations
        # Suggest alternatives
        # Update budget allocations
        pass
```
